        <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2007, we started as a trio of architects. Our 
            complimentary skills and relentless attention to detail 
            turned arch into one of the most sought after boutique 
            firms in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specializing in Urban Design allowed us to focus on creating 
            exceptional structures that live in harmony with their 
            surroundings. We consider every detail from every surrounding 
            element to inform our designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our small team of world-class professionals provides input 
            on every project.
